# igrowup_update

## **About**
IGROWUP is a stata macro developed by the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety for calculating the z-scores and prevalences for a nutritional survey.
UNICEF has updated the STATA macro to account for complex survey designs when generating standard errors and confidence intervals for prevalences.

## **Contact for reporting bugs/ comments**
Should you encounter any problems with this package, please send an e-mail with a clear description of the identified problem to "anthro2005@who.int" and "data@unicef.org", specifying in the subject line that it concerns the igrowup_Stata package , the name of the macro (igrowup_standard or igrowup_restricted) and kindly indicate which version of STATA you are using. Thank you.

## **Contents of package**
The package igrowup_stata contains the following items: 
1. Two macros (igrowup_standard.ado and igrowup_restricted.ado). 
2. Nine permanent (read-only) Stata data sets containing the WHO Child Growth Standards: weianthro.dta, lenanthro.dta, wflanthro.dta, wfhanthro.dta, bmianthro.dta, hcanthro.dta, acanthro.dta, tsanthro.dta and ssanthro.dta. 
3. The file Readme.pdf 
4. An example set, survey.dta. 
5. Two example do-files, survey_standard.do and survey_restricted.do. 
6. The example output files: mysurvey_z_st.xls, mysurvey_z_rc.xls, mysurvey_z_st.dta, mysurvey_z_rc.dta, mysurvey_prev_st.xls and mysurvey_prev_rc.xls.

## **Pre-requisites**
### **Individual level Z-score outputs**
**STATA Version 7.0 Stata/SE (Special Edition of Stata) or higher** is required to run two macros (igrowup_standard.ado and igrowup_restriced). 
Intercooled Stata has a limit of 2,047 variables and with that the macros will only produce the z-scores output files

### **Prevalence Estimates**
STATA Version 13.0 Stata/SE (Special Edition of Stata) or higher is required to generate prevalence estimates

### **Precautions**
1. Avoid any variable names starting with underscore "_" in the input STATA data set; otherwise they may be replaced by the derived ones created by the macro. 
2. Avoid any temporary format names starting with underscore "_"; otherwise they may be replaced by the temporary ones created by the macro. 
3. Avoid any STATA global macro variable names staring with underscore “_”, except those defined by the system. 

## **Recommended setup and run**

### Step 1. 
Create a sub-directory, for example "D:\WHO igrowup STATA", where you wish to save the package *(igrowup_stata.zip)*. This directory should be reserved only for the references tables *(anthro.dta)* and the macros *(igrowup_standard.ado and igrowup_restricted)* that are contained in the zip file.

### Step 2. 
Create a sub-directory, for example `"D:\WHO igrowup workdata"`, where the example data (survey.dta and pertaining output files) and your STATA input data can be stored and where all the macro output files will be written to.

### Step 3. 
It is recommended that you start by loading and running the example code below (also found in survey_standard.do or survey_restricted.do) in the STATA do-file editor to see how the data should be prepared and to fill in the macros' parameters according to their requirements. Note: The macros run on **Stata/SE**: The Special Edition version of Stata (type "`help SpecialEdition`"). For users of Intercooled Stata, the macros will only produce the z scores output files and the user gets the message 
 
`Please wait, programme is calculating prevalences.............`  <br>
